# WikiMap

An entirely vibe-coded experimental visualization for live wikipedia edits. Shows some live statistics, and collects the most notable edits into a live feed on the bottom using some heuristics.

Uses the free wikimedia stream as an event source, so absolutely no authentication is required. Also, everything is in one index.html for maximally easy deployment on github pages.

Visualization can be accessed on https://wallinm1.github.io/wikimap/
